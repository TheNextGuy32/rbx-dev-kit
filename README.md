# RBX Development Kit

## Goals

- Games are made up of player affordances and interlocking projects
- Affordances are player controls that trigger round trip communication that ends with all players receiving information about the input
- Each type of affordance is handled by a project that makes coding communication painless
- Projects are defined by specifications that make affordances clear
- Projects are autogenerated to match the most up to date service infrastructure using specs
- Projects can be regenerated to match the most up to data infrastrucutre without losing existing work
- Adding dependencies between projects is easy, and is not brittle or hard to change
- State is faked on the client and maintained on the server
- Client server communication is never in the same class that manages or fakes state
- Roact UI elements for each affordance of a project comes free
